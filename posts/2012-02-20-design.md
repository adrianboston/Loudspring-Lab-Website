<h2>Design is data.</h2>
<h4>Form is function.</h4>

<p>Our designs are driven by data and function. For valid reason. Slow sites get low Page Ranking (PR) and won't readily show up in a search engine. And, mobile devices have thinner bandwith.</p>
<p>Further, we design for the Next Generation of smaller screens found on iPhones, iPads, Notebooks and Android screens.</p>
<p>Factor in human's browsing behavior and it makes more sense. People have no time for a slow web; it's called hyper-text for a reason.</p>
<p>Basically, it's time to loudspring your website.</p>
