<h2>We build products that build strong Social Networks.</h2>
<h4>That includes Facebook apps, whether for Web or Mobile platforms.</h4>

<p>Why is that important? The new marketing boils down to engaging consumers in an genuine two-way relationship. It's not like the days of push advertising. You can't go viral without an enthusiastic public. That means a constant level of interaction and information with the public.</p>

<p>We can develop Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Google+ and dozens of other Social Networks Apps using their native API. That integrates not only systems, but people.</p>

<p>MingleVerse is one example. MingleVerse lies somewhere between Skype and SecondLife, in that is offers a way for distanced people to co-mingle in one shared space. With MingleVerse, a normal pair of headphones  turn your virtual reality into an understandable experience. Without it, you would never know who is speaking. MingleVerse offered a usable space for upto 50 people. Your brain can keep track of all those different people because voices fade away as they move away. And, people can even form smaller groups in that single room.</p>
