<p>We make Facebook apps, integrated in Web or Mobile platforms. Why? Today's marketing boils down to engaging consumers in an genuine two-way relationship. ~~
It's not like the days of push advertising. You can't go viral without an enthusiastic public. That means a constant level of interaction with the public.</p>
<p>MingleVerse is one example.MingleVerse lies somewhere between Skype and SecondLife, in that is offers a way for distanced people to co-mingle in one shared space. The problem with typical shared spaces is that you have no way of pin-pointing the speaker. That&#8217;s exactly where 3D spatial sound comes into play. With MingleVerse, a normal pair of headphones  turn your virtual reality into an understandable experience. Without it, you would never know who is speaking. Skpe, MSN and iChat are limited to about 3 or 4 people for purely cognitive reasons. MingleVerse offered a usable space for upto 50 people. Your brain can keep track of all those different people because voices fade away as they move away. And, people can even form smaller groups in that single room. Just think of a coffee joint or bar.</p>
<p>Email outdated the post; Skype or VOIP endangers long-distance calling. Because of it&#8217;s enhanced experience, MingleVerse  removed the need for constant in-person meetings. That carbon cost is too high in our era. MingleVerse was a cost-effective solution for replacing auto and flight traffic. It worked from any standard personal computer.</p>
<p>That requirement was made sure by a sophisticated mix of Flash and plugins. Plugins were written in Objective-C and C++ for OSX and Windows respectively. The Flash was a work of genius by Alina who pushed Flash into 3D using transformation matrices. It worked like a charm, and marks one of the few times that Flash has ever managed 3D. The server system was a sophisticated http server and IRC-type daemon hosted on Amazon Cloud Servers. It could manage 10,000 different users in 1,000 rooms and scale to even more.</p>
