<p>Loudspring team members have been working on Web applications and systems since 1994.
~~
We've been there since the beginning. One of these early sites included a financial payment gateway system for the clients, Cisco Systems and United Nations. The system worked flawlessly and it was heralded by the press for taking in $15 Million of donations for United Nations in less than 3 days.<span id="more-74"></span>The system consisted of 5 rack-mounted Intel-based machines, running RedHat Linux integrated with one Sun Microsystem&#8217;s E-450 running Oracle 7. The E-450 was a 4 processor one, which seemed a big deal at the time. It still is impressive considering that it benchmarked 1,500 Transactions Per Second. Those E-450 machines were so large they need to be wheeled in like a new dishwasher. Each RedHat Linux box ran the earliest HotSpot JVM, our Java app that connected via JDBC to the Relational DBMS. This system had to be faultless so the team hammered the site with 15 Dells machines running Webloading software. Each box managed to do around 100 financial Transactions per Second from a web form, and it was encrypted by SSL.</p>
<p>What are we saying here? We know Web-based financial transaction systems, and we know them well. Because of that, we can make you a fully integrated Web retailer.</p>
