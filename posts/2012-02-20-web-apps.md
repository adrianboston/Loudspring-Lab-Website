<p>Our team has worked on massive, scalable n-tier systems interfacing with Oracle, Sybase and EMC Storage Area Network systems since the mid-90s. ~~
We bring that million dollar technology to the Small and Medium-Sized Business. We host these sites on fully-scalable, redundant and load-balanced Cloud servers, whether Amazon, Rackspace or Heroku.</p>
<p>Our expertise include Drupal, Django, RubyOnRails, WordPress, Java, and .NET.</p>
<p>We have worked on systems that have taken in $15Million in e-payments in under 3 days. That system consisted of 5 load-balanced  RedHat machines integrated with Oracle running on a Sun E-450. It benchmarked 1,500 TPS and load-tested with 15 machines each running 100 web clients.</p>
<p>We know Web-based financial transaction systems, and we know them well. Because of that, we can make you a fully integrated Web retailer.</p>
