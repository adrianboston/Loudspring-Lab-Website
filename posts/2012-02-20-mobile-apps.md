<p>The App is the new website. It's why we focus on designing and creating custom Apps 
~~that provide an engaging mix of User Experience and business functionality. Our designers and developers have been there since the very beginning, releasing iPhone an iPad Apps when only 500 existed on the iTunes Store. We are strong in U/X design, Data visualization as well as Objective-C, Cocoa, Carbon, OpenGL, OpenGL, Sound and hardware integration.</p>
<p>In fact, we've also be early in doing OpenGL Apps.That means pressing the limits of the earliest iPhones to render on the screen at 30 Frames Per Second.</p>
