<p>DESIGNED for SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s digital marketing boils down to engaging consumers in an earnest two-way relationship. It&#8217;s not like the days of push advertising. You can&#8217;t go viral without an enthusiastic public. And, without a level of trust, you will never get an enthusiastic public. That means a constant level of interaction between consumer and producer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Designed for social&#8221; is our major line of thinking behind our design.</p>
<p>HARDWARE and INSTALLATIONS</p>

<p>Our Engineers have worked on shrink-wrapped electronics for 10+ years. That&#8217;s why we can do physical interactive projects, that are a combination of art and hardware. Whether it needs Arduino or micro-controlled motors, multiple LED monitors, lighting , sound, projection screens or  actuators and sensors, we can make your interactive project soar.</p>
<p>Plus, we provide engineering advice on iPhone/iPad hardware interfaces.</p>
