<h2>We provide engineering advice on iPhone/iPad hardware interfaces.</h2>
<h4>Our Engineers have worked on shrink-wrapped electronics for 10+ years.</h4>

<p>That's why we can do mobile hardware interfaces or interactive projects. We combine design, software and hardware. 

Whether it needs Arduino or micro-controlled motors, multiple LED monitors, lighting , sound, projection screens or  actuators and sensors, we can make your interactive project soar.</p>
