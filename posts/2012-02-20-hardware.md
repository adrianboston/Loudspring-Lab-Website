<p>We provide engineering advice on iPhone/iPad hardware interfaces.</p>
<p>Our Engineers have worked on shrink-wrapped electronics for 10+ years. That's why we can do physical interactive projects, that are a combination of art and hardware. Whether it needs Arduino or micro-controlled motors, multiple LED monitors, lighting , sound, projection screens or  actuators and sensors, we can make your interactive project soar.</p>
