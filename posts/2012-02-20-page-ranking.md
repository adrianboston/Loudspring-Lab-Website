<h2>People have no time for a slow web.</h2>
<h4>That means Speed, Page Ranking, Interaction and NextGen devices.</h4>

<p>It's well known that design attracts attention. Less known is that websites need to be designed for speed. For two reason. They won't easily show up in a search engine, and mobile devices have thinner bandwith. Moreover, websites need to be designed for the mobile's much smaller screens.</p>
<p>Basically, its a combo of math and design.</p>
<p>Call us if you need you are seeking to gain a market share on mobile screens.</p>

<p>NewYork-Tokyo, known as NYT is a company that puts on monthly cultural events in New York, bringing the best of Japan to the West, whether fashion, film or robots.</p>
<p>The NYT site enjoyed a large audience in the 2005-era but competition in the world of blogging at least halved their numbers. We determined that, all other things aside, the problem was speed. Their site failed to show up in Google and Bing, unless precise search terms were used. Organic search terms never revealed their site. Basically, the outcome of such poor Page Ranking is that a firm's customer base cannot grow by way of the Internet. That's devastating for a web-oriented firm.</p>
<p>Their site clocked in at over 16 seconds for a number of reasons, design, poor code and poor hosting service. We moved their site to a Cloud Server, clipped the unnecessary large images, pruned the poor PHP code, added Google's mod_pagespeed to their new server; and we got it humming to less than 4 seconds. Now that's a radical speed difference.</p>

<p>We can do that same for you, if you're having trouble attracting and keeping clients with your current Web design and system.</p>
