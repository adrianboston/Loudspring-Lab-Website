<p>Websites need to be designed for speed; otherwise, they will be less likely to show up in an organic search.</p>
~~
<p>NewYork-Tokyo, known as NYT is a company that puts on monthly cultural events in New York, bringing the best of Japan to the West, whether fashion, film or robots.</p>
<p>The NYT site enjoyed a large audience in the 2005-era but competition in the world of blogging at least halved their numbers. We determined that, all other things aside, the problem was speed. Their site failed to show up in Google and Bing, unless precise search terms were used. Organic search terms never revealed their site. Basically, the outcome of such poor Page Ranking is that a firm's customer base cannot grow by way of the Internet. That's devastating for a web-oriented firm.</p>
<p>Their site clocked in at over 16 seconds for a number of reasons, design, poor code and poor hosting service. We moved their site to a Cloud Server, clipped the unnecessary large images, pruned the poor PHP code, added Google's mod_pagespeed to their new server; and we got it humming to less than 4 seconds. Now that's a radical speed difference.</p>

<p>We can do that same for you, if you're having trouble attracting and keeping clients with your current Web design and system.</p>
